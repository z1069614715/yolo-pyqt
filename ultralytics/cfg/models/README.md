## Models

Welcome to the [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com) Models directory! Here you will find a wide variety of pre-configured model configuration files (`*.yaml`s) that can be used to create custom YOLO models. The models in this directory have been expertly crafted and fine-tuned by the Ultralytics team to provide the best performance for a wide range of object detection and image segmentation tasks.

These model configurations cover a wide range of scenarios, from simple object detection to more complex tasks like instance segmentation and object tracking. They are also designed to run efficiently on a variety of hardware platforms, from CPUs to GPUs. Whether you are a seasoned machine learning practitioner or just getting started with YOLO, this directory provides a great starting point for your custom model development needs.

To get started, simply browse through the models in this directory and find one that best suits your needs. Once you've selected a model, you can use the provided `*.yaml` file to train and deploy your custom YOLO model with ease. See full details at the Ultralytics [Docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models), and if you need help or have any questions, feel free to reach out to the Ultralytics team for support. So, don't wait, start creating your custom YOLO model now!

### Usage

Model `*.yaml` files may be used directly in the [Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/cli) with a `yolo` command:

```bash
# Train a YOLOv8n model using the coco8 dataset for 100 epochs
yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8n.yaml data=coco8.yaml epochs=100
```

They may also be used directly in a Python environment, and accept the same [arguments](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/cfg/) as in the CLI example above:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Initialize a YOLOv8n model from a YAML configuration file
model = YOLO("model.yaml")

# If a pre-trained model is available, use it instead
# model = YOLO("model.pt")

# Display model information
model.info()

# Train the model using the COCO8 dataset for 100 epochs
model.train(data="coco8.yaml", epochs=100)
```

## Pre-trained Model Architectures

Ultralytics supports many model architectures. Visit [Ultralytics Models](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models) to view detailed information and usage. Any of these models can be used by loading their configurations or pretrained checkpoints if available.
